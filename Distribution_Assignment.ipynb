        "1. Simulate 30 rolls with =RANDBETWEEN(1,6). What is the probability of rolling a 3 exactly 5 times? (Hint: Use BINOM.DIST)\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - in excel sheet\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Generate 100 values in Excel using the continuous uniform distribution RAND() and plot a histogram.Describe the shape of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - The histogram of the 100 values generated using RAND() is approximately uniform and rectangular in shape. The frequencies across the intervals are nearly equal, indicating that all values between 0 and 1 are equally likely. Minor fluctuations occur due to randomness and finite sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A dataset has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. What percentage of values lie between 45 and 55 if the data follows a normal distribution?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - The average (mean) value is 50.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most data values are close to the average.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard deviation is 5, which tells us how far values usually spread from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now:\n",
        "\n",
        "45 is 5 less than 50\n",
        "\n",
        "55 is 5 more than 50\n",
        "\n",
        "So, 45 to 55 means one standard deviation below and above the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, about 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the concept of standardization (z-score), and why is it important in data analysis? Explain the formula and how standardization transforms a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - Standardization is the process of converting data values into z-scores so that they can be compared on a common scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "A z-score tells us: how many standard deviations a data value is above or below the mean.\n",

        "5. What is Kurtosis and their type?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a distribution, especially the peakedness and heaviness of the tails compared to a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Types\n",
        "\n",

        "6.Explain why the uniform distribution is a good model for the outcome of rolling a fair die.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - The uniform distribution is a good model for rolling a fair die because each outcome (1 to 6) has the same chance of occurring. Since no number is favored over another, all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
        "\n",
        "This equal probability of all possible outcomes is exactly the main feature of a uniform distribution, where every value in the range has the same probability.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer - A log transformation is commonly used when data is skewed or shows unequal variance. It helps in two main ways: variance stabilization and normality improvement.\n",
